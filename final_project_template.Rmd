Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers. Feel free to change the theme and other display settings, but this is not required.

### Overview
Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what two faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.

> My research project will answer the question, can common risk-factors and patient demographic data be used to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients? For this research question, we will use a dataset of ~27,000 patients from the Unniversity of Pennsylvania Health System with well characterized risk factors for AKI and labeled outcome of AKI or no AKI. This dataset is provided by DEBI faculty member Todd Miano.

> I will discuss this project with Todd Miano, PharmD, PhD, DBEI, Critical Care Pharmacist and John Holmes, PhD, Professor of Medical Informatics in Epidemiology, who has experience in AKI prediction, machine learning projects.
