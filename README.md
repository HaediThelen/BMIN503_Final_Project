# Predicting Acute Kidney Injury in Hospitalized Patients from EHR Data
### BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project
### Haedi Thelen

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complications seen in hospitalized patients. The ability to predict which patients are at highest risk for AKI would allow clinicians to intervene and prevent poor patient outcomes. Despite many attempts, however, AKI predicting models fail to perform in way that motivates their use in clinical decision support. Understanding which risk factors contribute most to AKI prediction, and how those risk factors vary based on high-level characteristics such as ICU status, can inform future studies seeking to predict AKI. This study aims to identify how risk factors differ AKI by patient location in the hospital and how modeling approaches differ in their identification of important risk factors.
